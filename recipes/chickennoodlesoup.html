    <h2>From scratch chicken noodle soup recipe</h2>
    <p>This soup is delicious, easy and relatively quick to make. It starts with a mirepoix. Add your spices, broth and/or water and chicken to cook in the broth which will add plenty of flavor. Once the chicken is done and ready to shred, you can cook the noodles in the soup. Finish with a squeeze of lemon for extra goodness!</p>
